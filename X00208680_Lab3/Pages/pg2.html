    <h1>Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being</h1>
    <img src="theglobalgoals_icons_color_goal_3.png">
    <h2>Goal 3 is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</h2>
    <p>
        Good health is fundamental to enabling people to achieve their full potential and contribute to the development of society. Investments in health, for example through health care systems, are a reinvestment in the development of society as a whole. In addition, achieving optimal health, including access to necessary health care, food, water, clean air, sanitation, hygiene and medicines, is a fundamental right.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The global trend is that people are living longer, but support systems for elderly people are often lacking. The spread of globalisation also means an increased risk of spreading various types of health risks. Measures aimed at combating anti-microbial resistance are an important part of the work to provide protection against health threats and to ensure access to essential medicines. The reference to anti-microbial resistance is found in the political declaration.
